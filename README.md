Hello! I'm Abhishek Singh, a final year computer science engineering student with a passion for crafting innovative solutions through code. My technical skills includes proficiency in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and SQL.
As a proactive learner, I have honed my skills in both frontend development, where I can bring designs to life with precision and creativity, and Python development, where I excel in building robust and efficient backend systems. I am enthusiastic about creating seamless user experiences and leveraging the power of technology to solve real-world problems.

Currently on the lookout for opportunities in frontend development or Python development, I am excited to contribute my skills to projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
